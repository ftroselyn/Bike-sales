With the data prepared, the next chapter unfolded—a story of extraction and calculation. A separate worksheet was dedicated to the extraction of essential insights. The pivot table that emerged as the centerpiece stood as a beacon of analysis. Specifically, the pivot table showcased the Count of Purchased Bikes categorized by age groups—adolescents, middle-aged individuals, and seniors. This calculation provided a panoramic view of consumer preferences across generational divides, painting a vivid picture of how different age groups engage with bike purchases.

Each chart, graph, and visualization was carefully curated to tell a specific aspect of the story. The Average Income Per Purchase became more than just a metric; it transformed into a narrative of purchasing power and economic dynamics. The Costumer Age Bracket chart breathed life into demographic insights, narrating how each age group contributed to the sales landscape. The Costumer Commute visualization unfurled the tapestry of mobility patterns, revealing how transportation preferences impact buying decisions.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this journey through bike sales data is more than an exercise in analysis; it's a testament to the narrative potential of data.
